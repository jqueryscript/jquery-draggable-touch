jQuery Draggable Touch
======================

Make HTML elements draggable. Main implementation uses touch events, 
but the plugin also has a fallback that uses mouse events.

The main reason that this plugin exist is that there are currently no 
good jQuery plugin for making elements draggable, that has touch devices 
as it's main target (at least that I know of). `jQuery UI <http://jqueryui.com/draggable/>`_ 
has a draggable plugin which, together with `jQuery UI Touch Punch <http://touchpunch.furf.com/>`_, 
can be used to make elements draggable on touch devices. However, due to 
Touch Punch generating fake mouse events, and jQuery UI's draggable plugin, using these fake 
mouse events when dragging elements, it's error prone and contains weird bugs.

I decided it was simpler to just write a draggable plugin whose main target 
was touch devices, and that uses touch events (even though it still has a 
fallback on mouseevents when the browser/device doesn't support touch events).

Features
--------

* Main target is touch devices
* Small and simple
* Supports dragging multiple elements at the same time


Usage example
-------------

::

    $(".my-draggables")
        .draggableTouch()
        .bind("dragstart", function(event, pos) {
            console.log("drag started on:", this, "at position:", pos);
        })
        .bind("dragend", function(event, pos) {
            console.log("drag ended on:", this, "at position:", pos);
        });
    
::

    // to disable draggability
    $(".my-draggables").draggableTouch("disable");
